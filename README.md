# 3D-Renderer
The 3D Renderer is a custom ray tracer written in C that generates realistic 3D scenes with lighting, reflections, and shading. It optimizes ray-object intersections for performance and accuracy, providing hands-on experience with low-level graphics programming and computational geometry.
